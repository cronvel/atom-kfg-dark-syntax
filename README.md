# Atom Dark Syntax them supporting KFG and Spellcast!

This is the **official** syntax theme in Atom editor supporting:

* [**Kung-Fig**](https://github.com/cronvel/kung-fig): *The Kung Fu of configuration files!*
* [**Spellcast!**](https://github.com/cronvel/spellcast): *Make: your own adventure!*

Other syntax themes may be sub-optimal for KFG.
